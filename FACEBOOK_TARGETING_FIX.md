# Facebook CSV Import - Targeting Fix

## Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Facebook API was returning error "location_types is not a valid target spec field" when creating adsets during CSV import
- **Root Cause**: The `location_types` field was being included in the targeting specification, but Facebook API doesn't accept this field
- **Location**: `/api/facebook/import-csv/route.ts` in the `mapFacebookCsvToCampaignData` function

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed `location_types` from targeting
**File**: `d:\JOB\FACEBOOK_TOOLS\facebook-ads-manager\app\src\app\api\facebook\import-csv\route.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
targeting: {
  geo_locations: {
    custom_locations: [{
      latitude: latitude,
      longitude: longitude,
      radius: radius,
      distance_unit: 'kilometer'
    }]
  },
  genders: genders,
  age_min: ageMin,
  age_max: ageMax,
  location_types: csvRow['Location Types'] && csvRow['Location Types'].trim() ? 
    csvRow['Location Types'].split(',').map(s => s.trim()) : ['home', 'recent']
},
```

**After**:
```typescript
targeting: {
  ...(latitude && longitude && radius ? {
    geo_locations: {
      custom_locations: [{
        latitude: latitude,
        longitude: longitude,
        radius: radius,
        distance_unit: 'kilometer'
      }]
    }
  } : {}),
  genders: genders,
  age_min: ageMin,
  age_max: ageMax,
  targeting_automation: {
    advantage_audience: 0  // Disable Advantage Audience for more control
  }
  // Note: location_types is not supported by Facebook API, removed
},
```

### 2. Added required `targeting_automation` field
- Facebook API now requires the `advantage_audience` flag to be explicitly set
- Set to `0` to disable Advantage Audience for more precise targeting control
- This prevents the "Advantage Audience Flag Required" error

### 3. Added conditional geo_locations
- Added validation to only include `geo_locations` if valid coordinates are available
- This prevents sending invalid geographic targeting to Facebook API

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test with Facebook CSV Export File**:
   - Export a campaign from Facebook Ads Manager as CSV
   - Upload the file using the CSV Import feature
   - Verify that campaigns are created successfully without "location_types" errors

2. **Test with Various Location Data**:
   - Test with valid coordinates (should include geo_locations)
   - Test with missing coordinates (should exclude geo_locations)
   - Test with invalid coordinates (should use fallback)

3. **Check Logs**:
   - Monitor browser console for detailed logging
   - Check campaign creation logs for success/error status
   - Verify targeting structure in API requests

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ No more "location_types is not a valid target spec field" errors
- ✅ No more "Advantage Audience Flag Required" errors
- ✅ Campaigns create successfully with proper geographic targeting
- ✅ Falls back to default targeting when coordinates are missing
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging targeting issues

## Facebook API Targeting Structure
The targeting now follows Facebook's accepted format:
```typescript
{
  geo_locations: {
    custom_locations: [{
      latitude: number,
      longitude: number,
      radius: number,
      distance_unit: 'kilometer'
    }]
  },
  genders: number[],
  age_min: number,
  age_max: number,
  targeting_automation: {
    advantage_audience: 0  // Required field
  }
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Test the import feature with real Facebook CSV exports
2. Monitor for any other Facebook API compatibility issues
3. Consider adding more robust geographic targeting options
4. Potentially add support for country-based targeting as an alternative to custom locations

## Latest Fix: Creative Object Story Spec Issue

**New Problem**: Facebook API was rejecting creative creation with "Invalid creative's object story spec" error.

**Root Cause**: 
1. Using placeholder URL (`https://example.com`) in call_to_action link
2. Missing or invalid page_id in object_story_spec
3. Incorrect post_id extraction from Story ID field

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Improved Story ID parsing**: Extract numeric post_id from Facebook Story ID format (`s:123456789012345`)
2. **Better URL handling**: Use `https://facebook.com` as safe default link for call_to_action
3. **Enhanced page_id management**: Properly pass page_id through all campaign creation steps
4. **Added validation**: Check for post_id existence before attempting to use existing posts

**Files Modified**:
- `d:\JOB\FACEBOOK_TOOLS\facebook-ads-manager\app\src\lib\facebookApi.ts` - Creative creation logic
- `d:\JOB\FACEBOOK_TOOLS\facebook-ads-manager\app\src\app\api\facebook\import-csv\route.ts` - Story ID parsing and page_id handling

**Expected Result**: Campaigns now create successfully with proper creatives that use content from the CSV Body field.
